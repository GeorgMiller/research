## Research Interests

In general, I'm interested in the broad field of machine learning, but especially in the following topics, since I was already able to gain some experiences.

- reinforcement learning, meta learning, diversified learning
- quantum computation for machine learning
- hypernetworks


## Past Projects

### Univiersity Project: Local error signals

### University Project: Voicebots for social experiments

### University Project: RL in robotics

### Masterthesis Hypernetworks

In my masterthesis I developed a hypernetwork approach to enhance diversity for RL agents. I reimplemented several agents like DDQN and A3C as well as Muzero.
